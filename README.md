# Pizza-Sales-DA-project
Pizza Sales dashboard using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau, you can start by gathering relevant data such as sales transactions, customer demographics, product performance, and geographic sales distribution. In Power BI, you can create interactive visualizations like bar charts to show sales trends over time, a map visualization to display sales by location, and slicers to filter data by pizza type, customer segment, or sales channel. Excel can be used for data preparation, cleaning, and advanced calculations, such as forecasting future sales based on historical data or calculating profitability ratios for different pizza products. Tableau can complement this by offering additional visualization options, such as heat maps to identify sales hotspots, and dashboards that integrate data from multiple sources for a comprehensive view of pizza sales performance. The key is to ensure that each tool is used strategically based on its strengths: Power BI for dynamic and interactive reporting, Excel for data manipulation and complex calculations, and Tableau for advanced visualizations and data integration capabilities.
